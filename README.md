# odin-recipes

This project is a simple website that contains a main page with links to three diffrent
recipes. Each recipe has a header with the recipe name, a picture of the completed recipe,
an unordered ingredient list, and a ordered list with the steps to make the recipe.

After completing the project I have demonstrated the skill to use basic html elements,
to add text to an html document and have it display on a browser, to create ordered and
unordered lists, to add relative links to other html files, and to add images to an html
file.
