        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>All you need for these ghost cookies is a cookie cutter in the shape of a tulip and then turn it upside-down -
        if you don't have that one, you can easily freehand the ghost shapes. These are great giveaways for 
        trick-or-treaters and a nice alternative to all the candy. </p>
