        <!-- Description of the recipe -->

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>All you need for these ghost cookies is a cookie cutter in the shape of a tulip and then turn it upside-down -
        if you don't have that one, you can easily freehand the ghost shapes. These are great giveaways for 
        trick-or-treaters and a nice alternative to all the candy. </p>

         <!-- Steps to make recipe -->
         
         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
             <li>Beat butter in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar gradually, beating until 
            light and fluffy. Beat in egg and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt in a second bowl. Add flour mixture to the creamed butter mixture 
            and mix to combine. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Dust a work surface with flour and roll out dough into a thin circle. Cut out tulip shapes; if your tulip cookie cutter 
            has a stem, cut the stem off with a knife, so you have a stemless tulip shape. Arrange cut-out cookies on ungreased 
            baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from baking sheets carefully and transfer to 
            wire racks. Cool completely, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir 1 cup confectioners' sugar and milk together in a small bowl until smooth. Beat in corn syrup and 1/4 teaspoon 
            vanilla extract until icing is smooth and glossy. Add more corn syrup if icing is too thick.</li>
            <li>Spoon icing into a piping bag with a small plain tip. Pipe icing around the edge of each cookie to create a border. 
            Fill in the middle completely with icing. Stick 2 chocolate chip cookies into the wet icing for the eyes. Let cookies stand 
            until icing dries, about 1 hour.</li>
         </ol>
